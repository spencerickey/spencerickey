        "This program receives a dictionary of students names and their top three choices of a partner.\n",
        "The approach is one that really only works for realistic problems where people are present.\n",
        "In the real world, a class of students has friends who have favorites. There are always factors to consider in situations like these, and nothing is truly random.\n",
        "Thus, this program only analyzes such situations... an implementation (not in the coding sense of the word) would be in order for a random set of objects and their random choices.\n",
        "(The students could also be arbitrary numbers, other strings besides names, etc)\n",
        "In this approach, there is only one method. I did not bother to create a weight system and a \"fans_dict\" to solve the problem. \n",
        "Given the example dictionary and any other reasonable dictionary, this program will work (as far as I know).\n",
        "Anyway, enough of the introductory stuff... to the explanation of how the method works!\n",
        "This program takes a dictionary and iterates over its keys (I'll call them students or objects), dividing them up into perfect pairs based off the priority of their choices.\n",
        "First, it checks to see if two students chose each other as their first choice. \n",
        "  There is no case where these two shouldn't be paired together, as each student only gets three choices and can only choose one other student per choice.\n",
        "  This pair is added to the list of perfect pairs.\n",
        "  The original dictionary of students is decremented based off the pairs found. ie, students who have a pair are removed from future checks.\n",
        "Second, it checks if each remaining student's second choice of partner chose them as their first choice. This case is the second highest ranking in terms of priority. This is explained further in comments below.\n",
        "  This pair is added to the list of perfect pairs.\n",
        "  The dictionary is decremented again, deleting the students who have been paired.\n",
        "Thirdly, it checks if each remaining student's second choice chose them as their second choice.\n",
        "  This pair is added to the list of perfect pairs.\n",
        "  The dictionary is decremented, once again.\n",
        "This pattern continues until all three of each student's choices have been checked. Hopefully, all students will be paired at this point.\n",
        "If there still exist students who are not paired - sometimes this happens - those students will automatically be assigned a random group, given there are no more than two.\n",
        "If there are more than two students/objects leftover, the program gives feedback to the user to let them know something happened and how to fix it. \n",
        "Next, the program checks for duplicates and removed them. This happens because I didn't want to delete students during each iteration, maybe it saves memory or time *shrugs* I dunno\n",
        "Finally, it returns the list of perfect pairs (as long as no students were left out, otherwise it returns an error and how to fix the problem)!\n",
